# âž• It's MATHEMATICAL!

I often find myself needing to split grociery calcs between me an my roommate.  
And, usually the receipts are very similar to each other.

So I got to thinking: why not just create a SQLite database that stores these receipts  
and then access them with a CLI utility?

## Goal

The hope is that I just run the app, load up the last receipt, and then edit  
the quantities and change some of the prices as needed.

Treating this as a fun way to learn how to use the Bubbletea and Lipgloss libraries.
